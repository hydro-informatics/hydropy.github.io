# Generative AI Tools

This section provides an overview of generative AI tools, which can facilitate professional and everyday life. These tools are mostly types of large language models (LLMs), which have become particularly well-known with the rise of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology implemented in OpenAI's ChatGPT.

```{admonition} Caution!
:class: warning

AI tools can make life a lot easier, and are particularly effective at improving writing or overcoming creative writing blockages. However, the technical information and coherence provided by generative writing tools is often flawed and should never be used as such for any professional purpose or publication. In our experience, an LLM simply cannot make the logical connections that a professional human brain with many years of education is able to create. Even grammatical AI edits can completely change the meaning of a sentence.
